Tools such as merge requests, scrum boards, and well-crafted commit messages are pivotal in orchestrating team efforts seamlessly.</p>\n<h3>Merge Requests: Streamlining Code Integration and Review</h3>\n<p>Merge requests are not just about merging code; they are a gateway to peer review, ensuring code quality and consistency across the team’s output. However, without clear conventions, merge requests can vary in quality and detail, leading to inconsistencies and delays.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Merge Request:</strong> Include a descriptive title, a detailed summary of the changes, and a screenshot if applicable.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Code Review:</strong> Peer reviews from team members to ensure quality and adherence to coding standards.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ar0UOjJnEKR51ZOFhcsGSA.png\"><figcaption>Example of Merge Request including a descriptive title, detailed summary what changes on this MR, and you can provide a screenshot too</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g0uhzkEe2AROy6pu4hgj5A.png\"><figcaption>Code review from team members</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wfQexGT-oDJD8iVoFpd1Ig.png\"><figcaption>Another example of code review</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Descriptive Titles and Summaries:</strong> Each merge request should have a clear title and a summary that explains the why and what of the changes, facilitating quicker understanding and decision-making.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Incremental Changes:</strong> Smaller, more frequent merge requests are easier to review and integrate than larger ones, which can become cumbersome and error prone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Scrum Boards: Visualizing Progress and Priorities with Asana</h3>\n<p>Scrum boards are vital in agile environments to track the progress of tasks through various stages from “To Do” to “Done.” We use Asana to manage our scrum board, ensuring everyone is aligned and the project stays on track. Asana is a comprehensive project management tool designed to enhance collaboration and productivity within teams. With its user-friendly interface and robust feature set, Asana makes it easy to plan, track, and manage projects from start to finish.</p>\n<p><strong>Criticisms and Resolutions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Overload of Information:</strong> Too many tasks on the board can lead to confusion. Regular grooming sessions to refine and prioritize tasks can help maintain clarity.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Engagement:</strong> All team members must actively engage with the scrum board. Daily stand-ups can ensure everyone is aligned and the board reflects the true state of the project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key features of Asana (taken from </strong><a href=\"https://fitsmallbusiness.com/asana-review/\">https://fitsmallbusiness.com/asana-review/</a>)<strong>:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Unlimited projects and tasks: </strong>Create as many projects and tasks as you want in your account. Projects refer to the group of tasks presented in a table, a timeline, or a Gantt chart. Tasks are actionable steps assigned to individuals.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Unlimited messages:</strong> Send updates to an individual or a team. To help users coordinate tasks efficiently, Asana recommends a list of tasks you can share with a team member.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Project views:</strong> Choose among list, calendar, timeline, and Gantt views when tracking project activities and tasks.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Project dashboards:</strong> See graphs and charts representing completed, incomplete, overdue, and total number of tasks.

The approach to achieving these goals, however, varies widely among developers, blending objectivity in goal achievement with subjective creative processes. While developers should have the freedom to innovate, their work must also adhere to certain standards to ensure it meets user needs. Quality metrics are vital for evaluating whether software aligns with user requirements, making quality both a subjective and crucial measure of software efficacy.</p>\n<p>Software Quality Assurance (SQA) involves systematic processes ensuring that software products and activities conform to company, customer, and legal standards. From development to deployment, SQA helps mitigate risks, enhance product reliability, and ensure user satisfaction by maintaining high-quality standards throughout the software lifecycle.</p>\n<p>In this discussion, we’ll jump into the key attributes that enhance code quality and explore a tool designed to measure and improve this quality.</p>\n<h4>Essential Attributes for High-Quality Code</h4>\n<p>High-quality software is defined by several interconnected attributes that ensure it meets the highest standards of performance, reliability, and user satisfaction. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Usability and Functionality</strong>: Software should be intuitive and meet all specified requirements without a steep learning curve. This balance is crucial for user engagement and accuracy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Correctness and Reliability</strong>: Software must function flawlessly and consistently under various conditions, which is fundamental for maintaining user trust.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Maintainability, Flexibility, and Scalability</strong>: Software should be easy to update or modify, capable of adapting to user needs and scaling without extensive overhauls.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Testability and Efficiency</strong>: Efficient code not only performs well but also facilitates straightforward testing processes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Security</strong>: With rising cyber threats, protecting user data through robust security measures like authentication, authorization, and encryption is more important than ever.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Leveraging SonarQube</h4>\n<p>SonarQube offers a comprehensive, open-source solution for maintaining high standards of code quality. It automates the evaluation of code to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and performance issues across various programming languages. This tool also promotes adherence to coding standards and best practices.</p>\n<p>Let’s jump into how to set up SonarQube for your projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Install Docker</strong></p>\n<p>You should refer to the official Docker documentation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/\">https://docs.docker.com/engine/install</a></p>\n<p>After installing the docker, you can run this command to make sure it has been successfully installed</p>\n<pre>docker --version</pre>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0v2eWJK9k2in5E6CEjp8lA.png\"></figure><p><strong>Deploying SonarQube</strong></p>\n<p>To run SonarQube in Docker, use the command:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For Windows: docker run -d --name sonar --restart always -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:lts-community</li>\n<li>For MacOS: sudo docker run -d --name sonar --restart always -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:lts-community</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check the container’s status with docker ps -a to ensure it is running.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pUNxD1EaHCYHlXDCbQZQfw.png\"></figure><p>If you’re accessing SonarQube locally, you’ll typically use <a href=\"http://localhost:9000/\">http://localhost:9000/</a>. However, if SonarQube is deployed on a virtual machine (VM), you’ll need to use the VM’s public IP address instead, like <a href=\"http://44.206.137.70:9000/\">http://44.207.134.71:9000/</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Setting up GitHub App</strong></p>\n<p>Before using SonarQube to analyze your projects, set up a GitHub App to allow SonarQube to access your repositories. This setup involves specifying app settings, granting necessary permissions, and configuring webhook settings to enhance security. To set up your GitHub App for SonarQube integration, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click your profile picture icon on the top right of your screen and click “<strong>Your organizations</strong>” or visit this link <a href=\"https://github.com/settings/organizations\">https://github.com/settings/organizations</a>\n</li>\n<li>To the right of your organization, click “<strong>Settings</strong>”.</li>\n<li>Scroll down and expand “<strong>Developer settings</strong>”, then select “<strong>GitHub Apps</strong>”.</li>\n<li>Click “<strong>New GitHub App</strong>”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Provide the following general settings for your app:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>GitHub App Name</strong>: Choose a name for your app.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Homepage URL</strong>: You can use any URL, like <a href=\"https://www.sonarqube.org/\">https://www.sonarqube.org/.</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>User authorization callback URL</strong>: Use your SonarQube instance’s base URL, e.g., <a href=\"http://sonarqube.yourcompany.com/\">http://sonarqube.yourcompany.com</a>. Note that it must be accessible publicly.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Webhook URL</strong>: By default, webhooks aren’t allowed to point to the SonarQube server since version 8.9LTS. If not using code scanning alerts for security vulnerabilities in GitHub, clear the Webhook Active checkbox and the Webhook URL and Webhook secret fields.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Grant access for the following <strong>Repository permissions</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Checks: </strong>Read &amp; write</li>\n<li>\n<strong>GitHub Enterprise: Repository metadata — </strong>Read Only</li>\n<li>\n<strong>GitHub.com: Metadata — </strong>Read-only</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pull Requests: </strong>Read &amp; write</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For private repositories, grant access to the following <strong>Repository permissions</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Contents: </strong>Read-only</li></ul>\n<p>If setting up <strong>GitHub Authentication</strong>, in addition to the Repository permissions, grant access for the following <strong>Account permissions</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Email addresses: </strong>Read-only</li></ul>\n<p>And grant access for the following <strong>Organization permissions</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Members: </strong>Read-only</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Projects: </strong>Read-only</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Under “Where can this GitHub App be installed?,” select <strong>Any account</strong>.

By focusing on tests first, developers can ensure that their code meets the requirements and behaves as expected. In this article, we will explore how TDD works, its benefits for creating and maintaining software, and how it fits with other modern tech tools, particularly through the lens of the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.</p>\n<h4>Understanding the Red-Green-Refactor Cycle</h4>\n<p>The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is the heartbeat of TDD. It breaks down the development process into three distinct phases:</p>\n<p><strong>Red Phase</strong>:</p>\n<p>Write a failing test. In this stage, you will create test for features or functionalities that haven’t been developed yet. When running the test, the test will fail because the feature has not yet been implemented.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YYhemkFcdyZq-xaZHeBixg.png\"></figure><p><strong>Green Phase</strong></p>\n<p>Write just enough code to make the test pass. This often means the implementation is only preliminary and not necessarily the final version.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*08_4tXCJQMOEHrRZDTIV5g.png\"></figure><p><strong>Refactor Phase</strong></p>\n<p>Now that the test is passing, improve the code without altering its functionality. This could mean enhancing readability, reducing complexity, or applying design patterns.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HnvcPIIJ6tFUaoZaI4jaJA.png\"></figure><p>This cycle ensures that every feature is tested and meets the criteria set out before coding begins, which greatly increases software quality and reliability.</p>\n<h4>Integrating with CI/CD</h4>\n<p>For optimal results, TDD should be employed alongside other contemporary development techniques such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), which automates testing and deployments. This integration facilitates smoother updates and code integration without manual effort, critical in the TDD cycle where rapid iterations and immediate feedback are essential. With CI/CD, developers can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically run tests whenever code is pushed to a repository, ensuring that each integration meets the defined tests — a crucial aspect during the Red and Green phases.</li>\n<li>Automatically deploy the code to production environments once the tests pass, seamlessly transitioning from the Green phase to deployment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How to Apply TDD Effectively</h4>\n<p>To maximize the benefits of TDD, adhere to best practices such as aiming for high test coverage — ideally over 90%. This coverage ensures almost all aspects of the software are tested, significantly reducing bug risks. Here’s how to implement TDD:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Write a Test</strong>: Start by defining what your software function or endpoint should do, then write a test that checks for that behavior.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Run the Test</strong>: Execute the test, which should fail initially since the functionality hasn’t been implemented yet (Red phase).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Write the Code</strong>: Develop just enough code to pass the test (Green phase).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Run the Test Again</strong>: Re-test to ensure it now passes with the new code (Green phase).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Refactor the Code</strong>: Optimize the code’s structure while ensuring all tests still pass (Refactor phase).</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Why Use TDD Projects?</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Early Bug Detection:</strong> By writing tests first, developers can identify and fix bugs early in the development cycle, reducing the time and cost associated with late-stage bug fixes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Enhanced Code Quality:</strong> TDD encourages writing clearer, more modular code, which improves maintainability and readability.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Documentation:</strong> Tests serve as a form of live documentation that describes what the code does and why.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Safe Refactoring</strong>: With a solid set of tests, you can change the code confidently, knowing that any new bugs will be caught by the tests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Practical Example: Implementing TDD in FastAPI</h4>\n<p>To illustrate TDD, let’s consider a FastAPI project where we develop a feature to delete a note. This example includes setting up a test environment and moving through the TDD phases.</p>\n<p><strong>Setting Up the Test Environment with ‘test_db’</strong></p>\n<p>First, let’s set up our test environment using a pytest fixture named test_db. This setup will manage the database state independently for each test, creating and destroying the database as needed. This ensures that each test operates in a clean environment, free from side effects caused by other tests.</p>\n<pre>from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends<br>from fastapi.testclient import TestClient<br>from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String<br>from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base<br>from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session<br>import pytest<br><br># Define the database URL and engine<br>DATABASE_URL = \"sqlite:///./test.db\"<br>engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={\"check_same_thread\": False})<br>SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)<br>Base = declarative_base()<br><br># Model definition<br>class Note(Base):<br>    __tablename__ = \"notes\"<br>    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)<br>    title = Column(String)<br>    content = Column(String)<br><br>app = FastAPI()<br><br># Dependency injection for database sessions<br>def get_db():<br>    db = SessionLocal()<br>    try:<br>        yield db<br>    finally:<br>        db.close()<br><br>app.dependency_overrides[get_db] = get_db<br><br># Setting up pytest fixture for database handling<br>@pytest.fixture(scope=\"function\")<br>def test_db():<br>    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)<br>    db = SessionLocal()<br>    db.add(Note(id=1, title=\"Test Note\", content=\"This is a test note\"))<br>    db.commit()<br>    yield db<br>    db.close()<br>    Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=engine)</pre>\n<ol><li><strong>Red Phase (A Failing Test)</strong></li></ol>\n<p>Initially, write a test for a feature not yet implemented:</p>\n<pre>@app.delete(\"/notes/{note_id}\")<br>async def delete_note(note_id: int):<br>    raise NotImplementedError  # This is just a placeholder for the Red phase<br><br>client = TestClient(app)<br><br>def test_delete_note(test_db):<br>    response = client.delete(\"/notes/1\")<br>    assert response.status_code == 200  # We expect a 200 OK response, but this will fail</pre>\n<p>This test will fail because our delete_note function isn't implemented—it raises NotImplementedError</p>\n<p><strong>2.

Refactor Phase</strong></p>\n<p>Here, we can clean up our code, improve its structure, and possibly optimize for performance without changing its behavior.</p>\n<pre># In services/note.py<br>class NoteService:<br>    def __init__(self, db: Session):<br>        self.db = db<br><br>    def delete_note(self, note_id: int):<br>        note = self.db.query(Note).filter(Note.id == note_id).first()<br>        if not note:<br>            raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=\"Note not found\")<br>        self.db.delete(note)<br>        self.db.commit()<br><br>@app.delete(\"/notes/{note_id}\", status_code=http.HTTPStatus.OK)<br>async def delete_note(note_id: int, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):<br>    service = NoteService(db)<br>    return service.delete_note(note_id)</pre>\n<p>In the Refactor phase, we extracted database operations to a service layer (NoteService).

Similarly, in software development, refactoring improves the structure of your code, enhancing its understandability, maintainability, and extensibility. Unlike scheduled project tasks, refactoring is a continuous aspect of the coding process, embedded within daily activities as developers strive to enhance the codebase. Inspired by Martin Fowler’s influential work, this guide explores how refactoring can lead to more maintainable, efficient, and scalable codebases, with a special focus on applications using FastAPI.</p>\n<h3>The Need for Refactoring</h3>\n<p>Refactoring is crucial as it enhances code readability and structure without altering its external behavior. It serves multiple purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Reduces Technical Debt</strong>: By cleaning up legacy code and improving its structure.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Prevents Bugs</strong>: Cleaner code has fewer bugs and is easier to test.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Facilitates Feature Extensions</strong>: Well-organized code makes adding new features easier.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Improves Performance</strong>: Optimization during refactoring can lead to better application performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>When to Refactor</h4>\n<p>The optimal time for refactoring is indicated by various signs within the codebase:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Code Duplication</strong>: Multiple occurrences of the same or similar code.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Complex Conditional Statements</strong>: Difficult-to-read and maintain logical structures.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Large Functions or Methods</strong>: Methods that perform more than one function or are too long to easily follow.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Poor Naming Conventions</strong>: Names that do not clearly explain what the code does.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Performance Bottlenecks</strong>: Slow execution times that impact user experience.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Code Smells</strong>: Any patterns in the code that suggest a deeper problem.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Change in Requirements</strong>: Difficulty in extending the system with new features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These indicators help developers decide not only when but also where to focus their refactoring efforts.</p>\n<h4>Best Practices for Refactoring</h4>\n<p>Following best practices based on Martin Fowler’s work ensures effective refactoring:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Understand the Existing Code</strong>: Grasp the full context and functionality before making changes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Start with Small Changes</strong>: Make minor adjustments and scale up as those prove successful.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)</strong>: Consolidate duplicate code into single, reusable components.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Keep Methods Short</strong>: Break down large methods into smaller, manageable ones.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Use Descriptive Names</strong>: Choose clear and meaningful names for functions, variables, and classes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Implement Automated Testing</strong>: Use tests to ensure refactoring does not alter the desired outcomes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Refactor in Stages</strong>: Approach the process incrementally to manage risks better.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Maintain Functionality</strong>: Keep the software operational throughout the refactoring process.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Employ Version Control</strong>: Track all changes for possible rollback and collaborative efforts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Steps to Refactor</h3>\n<p>Effective refactoring follows a structured approach to ensure improvements without introducing new issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Identify the Issue</strong>: Use tools like linters or static analyzers to detect problems such as duplicated code, oversized methods, or complex conditionals.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Plan Your Changes</strong>: Develop a strategy that minimizes risk and allows for incremental implementation. For instance, you might decide to create a utility function to reduce duplicated code across endpoints.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Test</strong>: Before altering your code, ensure there is a comprehensive test suite. This will act as a safety net, catching any deviations from expected behavior.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Refactor</strong>: Implement changes cautiously, making small, verified updates. Continually test and adjust based on feedback and errors.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Test Again</strong>: After refactoring, re-run tests to confirm that the code still performs as intended and that no new issues have arisen.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Practical Application in FastAPI</h3>\n<p>Using FastAPI as an example, let’s explore how refactoring can significantly improve software design and code management:</p>\n<h4>Service Layer Pattern</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Scenario</strong>: In a FastAPI application, handling various types of file operations can lead to complex code structures if not managed properly. Direct instantiation within API endpoints makes the code hard to manage, test, and violates the <strong>Open/Closed Principle</strong> by being open to modification whenever new types are added.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Problem</strong>: Originally, all logic related to file operations was located within controller/upload.py. This approach made the code less modular and difficult to manage, especially as the application grew and new file operation types were introduced.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before Refactor:</p>\n<pre># Located in controller/upload.py<br>class UploadRouterTags(Enum):<br>    upload = \"upload\"<br><br>upload_router = APIRouter(prefix=\"/v1/upload\", tags=[UploadRouterTags.upload])<br><br>@upload_router.delete(\"/delete/{filename}\")<br>async def delete_audio(filename: str, user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):<br>    # Logic to check file ownership and perform deletion directly within the endpoint<br>    # Error handling and direct S3 client interaction<br>    # ...<br><br>    return {\"status_code\": 200, \"message\": \"Successfully deleted the audio file\"}</pre>\n<p>After Refactor:</p>\n<pre># services/upload.py<br>class UploadService:<br>    def __init__(self, bucket_name):<br>        self.bucket_name = bucket_name<br>        self.s3_client = boto3.client('s3')<br><br>    def check_user_ownership(self, filename, user_id):<br>        # Logic to verify user ownership<br>        return uuid_from_filename == user_id<br><br>    def delete_file(self, filename):<br>        # Centralized error handling and S3 operations<br>        # ...<br><br># controller/upload.py<br>@upload_router.delete(\"/delete/{filename}\")<br>async def delete_audio(filename: str, user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):<br>    service = UploadService(AWS_BUCKET_NAME)<br>    if not service.check_user_ownership(filename, str(user.id)):<br>        raise HTTPException(<br>            status_code=HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,<br>            detail=\"Unauthorized to delete this file\"<br>        )<br><br>    try:<br>        service.delete_file(filename)<br>    except ValueError as e:<br>        raise HTTPException(<br>            status_code=HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,<br>            detail=str(e)<br>        )<br>    except RuntimeError as e:<br>        raise HTTPException(<br>            status_code=HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,<br>            detail=str(e)<br>        )<br><br>    return JSONResponse(status_code=HTTP_200_OK, content=\"Successfully deleted the audio file\")</pre>\n<p><strong>Improvement</strong>:</p>\n<p>This refactoring enhances the application’s modularity and scalability by isolating the object creation and operation logic into the UploadService class. It simplifies the endpoint functions in controller/upload.py, making them easier to maintain and extend with new functionalities. This approach also reduces the risk of errors during extension and ensures that the application is easier to maintain.</p>\n<h4>Singleton</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Scenario</strong>: Managing database connections in a FastAPI application, where multiple database connection instances can lead to increased memory usage and potential data inconsistencies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Problem</strong>: Originally, a new instance of the Database class was created every time a database connection was needed, which is inefficient.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before Refactor:</p>\n<pre>def get_db():<br>    return Database()</pre>\n<p>This function creates a new instance of the Database class every time it is called, which is not efficient.</p>\n<p>After Refactor:</p>\n<pre>from sqlalchemy import create_engine<br>from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker<br><br># Database connection configuration<br>DATABASE_URL = \"postgresql+psycopg2://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;host&gt;/&lt;database&gt;\"<br><br># Create a single engine instance<br>engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)<br><br># Session factory bound to this engine<br>SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)<br><br>def get_db():<br>    # SessionLocal() is called once per request to ensure <br>    # a single session is used<br>    db = SessionLocal()<br>    try:<br>        yield db<br>    finally:<br>        db.close()</pre>\n<p><strong>Improvement</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This approach effectively manages the lifecycle of database sessions, where the engine and session factory setup ensures that<strong> only one</strong> instance of each is created and used across the application, resembling a<strong> Singleton patter</strong>n.</li>\n<li>In this refactored version, SessionLocal is a factory for creating sessions bound to the single engine instance, ensuring that all parts of the application interact with the database in a consistent manner. Each request obtains a session through the get_db generator function, which is properly closed once the request is completed, thereby preventing resource leakage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Breaking Down Complex Functions</h4>\n<p><strong>Scenario and Problem:</strong><br>In the get_current_user function of a FastAPI application, multiple responsibilities—extracting and verifying access tokens, fetching user details from the database, and error handling—are combined in one function.

This separation simplifies unit testing for each component individually and increases the reusability of functions like extract_access_token, which can now be utilized wherever similar functionality is required in the application.</p>\n<h4>Encapsulate Function within Class</h4>\n<p><strong>Scenario and Problem:</strong></p>\n<p>In the Waitlist class, time_now() is used to provide a default timestamp with the UTC timezone. However, defining it outside of the class could potentially lead to issues if you need different behaviors or timezone configurations for other models or parts of your application.</p>\n<p>Before Refactor:</p>\n<pre>from pytz import timezone<br>from datetime import datetime<br><br>UTC = timezone(\"UTC\")<br><br>def time_now():<br>    return datetime.now(UTC)<br><br>class Waitlist(Base):<br>    __tablename__ = \"waitlist\"<br>    email = Column(String(225), nullable=False, unique=True, primary_key=True)<br>    date_waitlist = Column(TIMESTAMP(timezone=True), default=time_now, nullable=False)<br>    is_sent = Column(Boolean, default=False, nullable=False)<br>    date_sent = Column(TIMESTAMP(timezone=True), default=None)</pre>\n<p>After Refactor:</p>\n<pre>from pytz import timezone<br>from datetime import datetime<br>from src.utils.db import Base<br><br>class Waitlist(Base):<br>    __tablename__ = \"waitlist\"<br>    email = Column(String(225), nullable=False, unique=True, primary_key=True)<br>    date_waitlist = Column(TIMESTAMP(timezone=True), default=lambda: Waitlist.time_now(), nullable=False)<br>    is_sent = Column(Boolean, default=False, nullable=False)<br>    date_sent = Column(TIMESTAMP(timezone=True), default=None)<br><br>    @staticmethod<br>    def time_now():<br>        UTC = timezone(\"UTC\")<br>        return datetime.now(UTC)</pre>\n<p><strong>Improvement:</strong></p>\n<p>You encapsulate the function, improving the cohesion of the class. The class now controls its dependencies better, and changes to time_now() or its usage context (like changing the timezone) are encapsulated within the class, making it easier to maintain.

Similarly, in software development, refactoring improves the structure of your code, enhancing its understandability, maintainability, and extensibility. Unlike scheduled project tasks, refactoring is a continuous aspect of the coding process, embedded within daily activities as developers strive to enhance the codebase. Inspired by Martin Fowler’s influential work, this guide explores how refactoring can lead to more maintainable, efficient, and scalable codebases, with a special focus on applications using FastAPI.</p>\n<h3>The Need for Refactoring</h3>\n<p>Refactoring is crucial as it enhances code readability and structure without altering its external behavior. It serves multiple purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Reduces Technical Debt</strong>: By cleaning up legacy code and improving its structure.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Prevents Bugs</strong>: Cleaner code has fewer bugs and is easier to test.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Facilitates Feature Extensions</strong>: Well-organized code makes adding new features easier.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Improves Performance</strong>: Optimization during refactoring can lead to better application performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>When to Refactor</h4>\n<p>The optimal time for refactoring is indicated by various signs within the codebase:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Code Duplication</strong>: Multiple occurrences of the same or similar code.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Complex Conditional Statements</strong>: Difficult-to-read and maintain logical structures.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Large Functions or Methods</strong>: Methods that perform more than one function or are too long to easily follow.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Poor Naming Conventions</strong>: Names that do not clearly explain what the code does.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Performance Bottlenecks</strong>: Slow execution times that impact user experience.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Code Smells</strong>: Any patterns in the code that suggest a deeper problem.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Change in Requirements</strong>: Difficulty in extending the system with new features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These indicators help developers decide not only when but also where to focus their refactoring efforts.</p>\n<h4>Best Practices for Refactoring</h4>\n<p>Following best practices based on Martin Fowler’s work ensures effective refactoring:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Understand the Existing Code</strong>: Grasp the full context and functionality before making changes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Start with Small Changes</strong>: Make minor adjustments and scale up as those prove successful.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)</strong>: Consolidate duplicate code into single, reusable components.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Keep Methods Short</strong>: Break down large methods into smaller, manageable ones.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Use Descriptive Names</strong>: Choose clear and meaningful names for functions, variables, and classes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Implement Automated Testing</strong>: Use tests to ensure refactoring does not alter the desired outcomes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Refactor in Stages</strong>: Approach the process incrementally to manage risks better.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Maintain Functionality</strong>: Keep the software operational throughout the refactoring process.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Employ Version Control</strong>: Track all changes for possible rollback and collaborative efforts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Steps to Refactor</h3>\n<p>Effective refactoring follows a structured approach to ensure improvements without introducing new issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Identify the Issue</strong>: Use tools like linters or static analyzers to detect problems such as duplicated code, oversized methods, or complex conditionals.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Plan Your Changes</strong>: Develop a strategy that minimizes risk and allows for incremental implementation. For instance, you might decide to create a utility function to reduce duplicated code across endpoints.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Test</strong>: Before altering your code, ensure there is a comprehensive test suite. This will act as a safety net, catching any deviations from expected behavior.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Refactor</strong>: Implement changes cautiously, making small, verified updates. Continually test and adjust based on feedback and errors.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Test Again</strong>: After refactoring, re-run tests to confirm that the code still performs as intended and that no new issues have arisen.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Practical Application in FastAPI</h3>\n<p>Using FastAPI as an example, let’s explore how refactoring can significantly improve software design and code management:</p>\n<h4>Service Layer Pattern</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Scenario</strong>: In a FastAPI application, handling various types of file operations can lead to complex code structures if not managed properly. Direct instantiation within API endpoints makes the code hard to manage, test, and violates the <strong>Open/Closed Principle</strong> by being open to modification whenever new types are added.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Problem</strong>: Originally, all logic related to file operations was located within controller/upload.py. This approach made the code less modular and difficult to manage, especially as the application grew and new file operation types were introduced.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before Refactor:</p>\n<pre># Located in controller/upload.py<br>class UploadRouterTags(Enum):<br>    upload = \"upload\"<br><br>upload_router = APIRouter(prefix=\"/v1/upload\", tags=[UploadRouterTags.upload])<br><br>@upload_router.delete(\"/delete/{filename}\")<br>async def delete_audio(filename: str, user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):<br>    # Logic to check file ownership and perform deletion directly within the endpoint<br>    # Error handling and direct S3 client interaction<br>    # ...<br><br>    return {\"status_code\": 200, \"message\": \"Successfully deleted the audio file\"}</pre>\n<p>After Refactor:</p>\n<pre># services/upload.py<br>class UploadService:<br>    def __init__(self, bucket_name):<br>        self.bucket_name = bucket_name<br>        self.s3_client = boto3.client('s3')<br><br>    def check_user_ownership(self, filename, user_id):<br>        # Logic to verify user ownership<br>        return uuid_from_filename == user_id<br><br>    def delete_file(self, filename):<br>        # Centralized error handling and S3 operations<br>        # ...<br><br># controller/upload.py<br>@upload_router.delete(\"/delete/{filename}\")<br>async def delete_audio(filename: str, user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):<br>    service = UploadService(AWS_BUCKET_NAME)<br>    if not service.check_user_ownership(filename, str(user.id)):<br>        raise HTTPException(<br>            status_code=HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,<br>            detail=\"Unauthorized to delete this file\"<br>        )<br><br>    try:<br>        service.delete_file(filename)<br>    except ValueError as e:<br>        raise HTTPException(<br>            status_code=HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,<br>            detail=str(e)<br>        )<br>    except RuntimeError as e:<br>        raise HTTPException(<br>            status_code=HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,<br>            detail=str(e)<br>        )<br><br>    return JSONResponse(status_code=HTTP_200_OK, content=\"Successfully deleted the audio file\")</pre>\n<p><strong>Improvement</strong>:</p>\n<p>This refactoring enhances the application’s modularity and scalability by isolating the object creation and operation logic into the UploadService class. It simplifies the endpoint functions in controller/upload.py, making them easier to maintain and extend with new functionalities. This approach also reduces the risk of errors during extension and ensures that the application is easier to maintain.</p>\n<h4>Singleton</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Scenario</strong>: Managing database connections in a FastAPI application, where multiple database connection instances can lead to increased memory usage and potential data inconsistencies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Problem</strong>: Originally, a new instance of the Database class was created every time a database connection was needed, which is inefficient.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before Refactor:</p>\n<pre>def get_db():<br>    return Database()</pre>\n<p>This function creates a new instance of the Database class every time it is called, which is not efficient.</p>\n<p>After Refactor:</p>\n<pre>from sqlalchemy import create_engine<br>from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker<br><br># Database connection configuration<br>DATABASE_URL = \"postgresql+psycopg2://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;host&gt;/&lt;database&gt;\"<br><br># Create a single engine instance<br>engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)<br><br># Session factory bound to this engine<br>SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)<br><br>def get_db():<br>    # SessionLocal() is called once per request to ensure <br>    # a single session is used<br>    db = SessionLocal()<br>    try:<br>        yield db<br>    finally:<br>        db.close()</pre>\n<p><strong>Improvement</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This approach effectively manages the lifecycle of database sessions, where the engine and session factory setup ensures that<strong> only one</strong> instance of each is created and used across the application, resembling a<strong> Singleton patter</strong>n.</li>\n<li>In this refactored version, SessionLocal is a factory for creating sessions bound to the single engine instance, ensuring that all parts of the application interact with the database in a consistent manner. Each request obtains a session through the get_db generator function, which is properly closed once the request is completed, thereby preventing resource leakage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Breaking Down Complex Functions</h4>\n<p><strong>Scenario and Problem:</strong><br>In the get_current_user function of a FastAPI application, multiple responsibilities—extracting and verifying access tokens, fetching user details from the database, and error handling—are combined in one function. This overcomplication makes the code difficult to maintain, understand, and test, which hampers scalability and reliability.</p>\n<p>Before Refactor:</p>\n<pre>def get_current_user(request: Request, session: Session = Depends(get_db)):<br>    access_token = request.headers.get(\"Authorization\")<br>    if access_token:<br>        access_token = access_token.split(\" \")[1].replace('\"', '')<br>        user = session.query(User).filter(User.access_token == access_token).first()<br>        if user:<br>            return user<br>    raise HTTPException(status_code=HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED, detail=\"Not authenticated\")</pre>\n<p>After Refactor:</p>\n<pre>def extract_access_token(request: Request):<br>    token = request.headers.get(\"Authorization\")<br>    if not token:<br>        raise HTTPException(status_code=HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED, detail=\"Not authenticated\")<br>    return token.split(\" \")[1].replace('\"', '')<br><br>def fetch_user_by_token(session: Session, access_token: str):<br>    user = session.query(User).filter(User.access_token == access_token).first()<br>    if not user:<br>        raise HTTPException(status_code=HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED, detail=\"User not found\")<br>    return user<br><br>def get_current_user(request: Request, session: Session = Depends(get_db)):<br>    access_token = extract_access_token(request)<br>    return fetch_user_by_token(session, access_token)</pre>\n<p><strong>Improvements:</strong></p>\n<p>The refactoring results in a clear <strong>separation of concerns:</strong> each function now has a distinct responsibility, enhancing the maintainability and readability of the code. This separation simplifies unit testing for each component individually and increases the reusability of functions like extract_access_token, which can now be utilized wherever similar functionality is required in the application.</p>\n<h4>Encapsulate Function within Class</h4>\n<p><strong>Scenario and Problem:</strong></p>\n<p>In the Waitlist class, time_now() is used to provide a default timestamp with the UTC timezone. However, defining it outside of the class could potentially lead to issues if you need different behaviors or timezone configurations for other models or parts of your application.</p>\n<p>Before Refactor:</p>\n<pre>from pytz import timezone<br>from datetime import datetime<br><br>UTC = timezone(\"UTC\")<br><br>def time_now():<br>    return datetime.now(UTC)<br><br>class Waitlist(Base):<br>    __tablename__ = \"waitlist\"<br>    email = Column(String(225), nullable=False, unique=True, primary_key=True)<br>    date_waitlist = Column(TIMESTAMP(timezone=True), default=time_now, nullable=False)<br>    is_sent = Column(Boolean, default=False, nullable=False)<br>    date_sent = Column(TIMESTAMP(timezone=True), default=None)</pre>\n<p>After Refactor:</p>\n<pre>from pytz import timezone<br>from datetime import datetime<br>from src.utils.db import Base<br><br>class Waitlist(Base):<br>    __tablename__ = \"waitlist\"<br>    email = Column(String(225), nullable=False, unique=True, primary_key=True)<br>    date_waitlist = Column(TIMESTAMP(timezone=True), default=lambda: Waitlist.time_now(), nullable=False)<br>    is_sent = Column(Boolean, default=False, nullable=False)<br>    date_sent = Column(TIMESTAMP(timezone=True), default=None)<br><br>    @staticmethod<br>    def time_now():<br>        UTC = timezone(\"UTC\")<br>        return datetime.now(UTC)</pre>\n<p><strong>Improvement:</strong></p>\n<p>You encapsulate the function, improving the cohesion of the class.

To keep up with this dynamic environment, teams need to leverage advanced tools and practices. Git, a powerful version control system, plays a crucial role in maintaining code quality, collaboration, and project organization. By leveraging advanced Git features alongside comprehensive project management tools, teams can achieve greater efficiency and productivity. This integration embodies the ethos of “Teamwork Makes The Dream Work”. This article explores advanced Git commands, project management techniques, and performance monitoring methods to provide actionable insights for enhancing team performance.</p>\n<h3>Advanced Git Techniques</h3>\n<h3>Cherry-Pick</h3>\n<p>Cherry-picking in Git allows you to select specific commits from one branch and apply them to another. This is useful when you want to incorporate certain changes without merging the entire branch.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Source\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6Trjeu9v8dsTh2MU-ZOFyg.png\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://blog.geekhunter.com.br/git-cherry-pick-o-que-e-quando-usar/\">source</a></figcaption></figure><pre># Switch to the target branch<br>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;<br><br># Look for commit you want to cherry-pick, and copy its hash code<br>git graph --oneline <br># or<br>git log<br><br># Cherry-pick the commit<br>git cherry-pick &lt;commit-hash&gt;</pre>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre># Before<br>  a - b - c - d    Main<br>       \\<br>         e - f - g Feature<br><br>git checkout main<br><br># Search for commit reference<br>git cherry-pick f<br><br># After <br>  a - b - c - d - f Main<br>       \\<br>         e - f - g  Feature</pre>\n<p>After cherry-picking, Git applies the changes from that specific commit onto your current branch. So now, your “main” branch has the changes from commit “f” without merging the entire “feature” branch.</p>\n<h4>Revert</h4>\n<p>When you’ve made a mistake in your project, like adding a bug or breaking something unintentionally with a commit. Instead of deleting or changing the original commit (which can mess up your project’s history), Git gives you a safe way to undo those changes using git revert.</p>\n<pre># Find the commit hash to revert<br>git log<br><br># Revert the commit<br>git revert &lt;commit-hash&gt;</pre>\n<p>The advantage of git revert is that it doesn't alter your project's history. Instead, it adds a new commit that effectively cancels out the changes from the commit you want to revert.</p>\n<h4>Stash</h4>\n<p>git stash temporarily stores changes that are not ready for commit, allowing you to switch tasks or branches without losing your progress.</p>\n<pre># Stash changes<br>git stash<br><br># Switch to another branch or task<br>git switch ..<br><br># Retrieve stashed changes later<br>git stash apply<br><br># Show all stash created<br>git stash list<br><br># Trace stash<br>git stash show</pre>\n<h4>Reset</h4>\n<p>With git reset, developers can adjust the state of the current branch, with three modes of git reset:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>--hard: Completely discards any changes you’ve made since the specified commit and resets both your working directory and the staging area to match the commit you’re resetting to.</li>\n<li>--soft: Keeps your changes in your working directory and staging area, but it moves your branch pointer back to the specified commit. It’s like preparing your changes for a new commit without losing them.</li>\n<li>--mixed: Resets your staging area to match the specified commit but keeps your changes in your working directory. It's like saying, \"Okay, I don't want to commit these changes yet, but I want to keep them around.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<pre># Reset the branch to the specified commit<br>git reset --hard &lt;commit-hash&gt;</pre>\n<p>Reminder, when using git reset, always double-check the commit you're resetting to and make sure you understand the consequences of each mode (--hard, --soft, --mixed). It's a powerful tool, but it can also cause data loss if used carelessly.</p>\n<h4>Clean</h4>\n<p>The git cleanremoves untracked files and directories from your working directory, keeping it clean and organized.</p>\n<pre># Perform a dry run to see what files would be removed<br>git clean -n<br><br># Remove the files<br>git clean -f<br><br># Remove untracked directories<br>git clean -d</pre>\n<p>By using git clean, you can keep your working directory clean and organized, removing any unnecessary files and directories that may have accumulated during development. Just be cautious when using the -f flag to avoid accidentally deleting important files.</p>\n<h4>Rebase</h4>\n<p>Rebasing allows you to rewrite the commit history by moving, combining, or modifying commits, often used to maintain a linear history and incorporate changes from other branches.</p>\n<pre># Switch to the branch you want to rebase<br>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;<br><br># Start the rebase process<br>git rebase &lt;base-branch&gt;</pre>\n<h4>Diff</h4>\n<p>Analyzing differences between files or commits helps identify changes, conflicts, and potential issues.</p>\n<pre># Compare working directory with staging area<br>git diff<br><br># Compare staged changes with last commit<br>git diff --staged<br><br># Compare two commits<br>git diff &lt;commit1&gt; &lt;commit2&gt;</pre>\n<h4>Commit</h4>\n<p>Following best practices for commit messages is crucial for maintaining a clear and organized project history. Use semantic commit messages to provide concise summaries of changes and their impact. A common commit messages use &lt;type&gt;: &lt;description&gt; format. Common types are “fix”, “feat”, “test”, “style”, and “refactor”. The description should be short and clear about what changes made in this commit.</p>\n<pre>git commit -m \"feat: Implement new feature A\"</pre>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*x9t9EnPsl_b-Ruy1-j74hA.png\"><figcaption>Example git commit messages</figcaption></figure><h3>Advanced Project Management Features</h3>\n<h4>Task Management with Asana</h4>\n<p>Asana is a comprehensive project management tool that facilitates task assignment, progress tracking, and collaboration among team members.

It supports asynchronous programming and comes with automatic data validation, making it an ideal choice for developing efficient and scalable applications. Integrating SOLID principles into your FastAPI projects not only enhances code maintainability but also ensures that your APIs remain robust as they scale.</p>\n<p>Let’s get into these principles and how they apply to FastAPI!</p>\n<h3>S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h3>\n<p>Each module or class should have<strong> only one reason to change</strong>, meaning that it should have only <strong>one responsibility</strong>. In FastAPI, this can be applied by managing your application into<strong> separate components</strong>.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/560/1*e5q7qryFmUHIs2fl8z8qBg.png\"><figcaption>Example of the module structures</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Controllers: Use to manage API endpoints. Remember to adhere SRP, each endpoint should only do one thing.</li></ul>\n<pre>@auth_router.post(\"/login\", tags=[AuthRouterTags.auth])<br>async def login(credentials: Credentials):<br>    # Login logic<br>    pass<br>def login(<br>    response: Response,<br>    payload: LoginSchema = Body(),<br>    session: Session = Depends(get_db),<br>):<br>    return auth.login(response, session, payload)<br><br>@auth_router.post(\"/logout\", tags=[AuthRouterTags.auth])<br>def logout(<br>    response: Response,<br>    payload: LogoutSchema = Body(),<br>    session: Session = Depends(get_db),<br>):<br>    \"\"\"Processes user's logout request.\"\"\"o<br>    return auth.logout(response, session, payload)</pre>\n<ul><li>Models: Use to represent your data structures their database mapping. SQLAlchemy is a popular choice for ORM in FastAPI.</li></ul>\n<pre>from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String<br>from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base<br><br>Base = declarative_base()<br><br>class User(Base):<br>    __tablename__ = \"users\"<br>    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)<br>    email = Column(String, unique=True, nullable=False)<br>    username = Column(String, nullable=False)</pre>\n<ul><li>Schemas: Define the structures of your data for input validation and data serialization or deserialization.</li></ul>\n<pre>from pydantic import BaseModel<br><br>class UserCreateSchema(BaseModel):<br>    email: str<br>    username: str<br>    password: str</pre>\n<ul><li>Services: Use to contain core logic of your application, facilitating interactions with models and other data layers. Each function in a service should be focused on performing a single, well-defined task.</li></ul>\n<pre>from .models import User<br>from .db import Session<br><br>def create_user(session: Session, user_data: UserCreateSchema):<br>    db_user = User(username=user_data.username, email=user_data.email, password=user_data.password)<br>    session.add(db_user)<br>    session.commit()<br>    session.refresh(db_user)<br>    return db_user</pre>\n<ul><li>Utils: Contain reusable utility functions that provide common functionalities across your application.</li></ul>\n<pre>def hash_password(password: bytes) -&gt; bytes:<br>    return bcrypt.hashpw(password, bcrypt.gensalt())</pre>\n<blockquote><strong>Integrating DRY with SRP</strong></blockquote>\n<p>DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns. Integrating DRY within SRP means ensuring that functionalities that are used multiple times across different modules or classes are abstracted into their own single responsibility units. This not only reduces code duplication but also aligns with SRP by compartmentalizing responsibilities.</p>\n<p>For example, if authentication logic is used in multiple places, instead of duplicating the verification code, it should be extracted into a separate authentication service or utility function. This approach upholds SRP by assigning the responsibility of authentication to a single, dedicated component and adheres to DRY by avoiding code repetition across different endpoints or services.</p>\n<p><strong>Example of SRP violation and Lack of DRY:</strong></p>\n<p>Combining user retrieval and update in a single endpoint does more than one thing, thus violating SRP, and if similar logic is repeated elsewhere, it also breaches the DRY principle:</p>\n<pre>@app.post(\"/user/{user_id}\")<br>async def get_and_update_user(user_id: int, update_data: UserUpdateSchema):<br>    user = get_user_by_id(user_id)  # Retrieve user<br>    if not user:<br>        return {\"error\": \"User not found\"}<br><br>    if update_data.should_update:<br>        updated_user = update_user(user_id, update_data)<br>        return {\"message\": \"User updated\", \"user\": updated_user}<br><br>    return {\"user\": user}</pre>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Best Practice</strong>:</blockquote>\n<p>The correct way is to separate those two functionalities into different endpoints for retrieval (GET /user/{user_id}) and update (PATCH /user/{user_id}). Each endpoint should then call on dedicated functions that handle one specific task, ensuring both SRP and DRY principles are respected.</p>\n<h3>O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</h3>\n<p>Object or entities, such as classes, modules, and functions, should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This principle relates to inheritance in OOP. It highlights the importance of making existing classes to be easily inherited. Rather than altering or modifying a class, which might degrade its quality, it’s preferable to design the class with openness for inheritance. Inheritance should be applied when encounter similar requirements.</p>\n<pre>from typing import Optional<br>from pydantic import UUID4, BaseModel, Field, EmailStr<br><br>class UserBaseSchema(BaseModel):<br>    email: EmailStr<br>    first_name: str<br>    middle_name: str<br>    last_name: str<br><br>class UserSchema(UserBaseSchema):<br>    id: UUID4<br>    is_active: bool = Field(default=False)<br>    refresh_token: Optional[str]<br>    access_token: Optional[str]<br><br>    class Config:<br>        from_attributes = True</pre>\n<p>In this example, UserSchema extends UserBaseSchema to add more attributes without modifying the original UserBaseSchema class. This demonstrates the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Open for Extension</strong>: You have added new functionality (additional fields like id, is_active, refresh_token, and access_token) by extending UserBaseSchema.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Closed for Modification</strong>: You have not changed UserBaseSchema. It remains intact and unchanged, ensuring existing functionality is not broken.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example of OCP violation:</p>\n<p>A common violation of the OCP occurs when a class is modified to add new functionality instead of creating a new class to extend the existing one. Using the same context, here’s how the violation would look if UserBaseSchema was modified directly:</p>\n<pre>from typing import Optional<br>from pydantic import UUID4, BaseModel, Field, EmailStr<br><br>class UserBaseSchema(BaseModel):<br>    email: EmailStr<br>    first_name: str<br>    middle_name: str<br>    last_name: str<br>    id: UUID4  # Added field, which modifies the original class<br>    is_active: bool = Field(default=False)  # Added field<br>    refresh_token: Optional[str]  # Added field<br>    access_token: Optional[str]  # Added field<br><br>    class Config:<br>        from_attributes = True</pre>\n<p>What you should is making a new class UserSchema which extends UserBaseSchema</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Best Practice</strong>:</blockquote>\n<p>The best practice is to maintain the integrity of the original class by extending it through inheritance, as demonstrated in the correct example. This method adheres to the OCP by allowing the base class to remain unchanged and robust, while new functionality is added in a derived class, promoting reusability and easier maintenance.</p>\n<h3>L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</h3>\n<p>Objects of a superclass can be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the program’s functionality.</p>\n<p>In simple way, if you are making an instance from class B, which is a child class from parent class A, then you should be able to use objects of class B wherever objects of class A are expected, without causing any unexpected behavior or errors. This ensures that the class B (subclass) can seamlessly subsitute the class A (superclass) in any context.</p>\n<pre>class Book(BaseModel):<br>    title: str<br>    def apply_discount(self):<br>        # Logic for applying discount<br>        return \"Discount applied\"<br><br>class SaleBook(Book):<br>    def apply_discount(self):<br>        discount = super().apply_discount()<br>        return f\"{discount} and Sale discount applied\"<br><br>@app.get(\"/sale-book\")<br>def sale_book():<br>    book = SaleBook(title=\"Harry Potter\")<br>    return {\"message\": book.apply_discount()}</pre>\n<p>In this example, SaleBookcan replaceBookwithout altering the expected behavior, adhering to the superclass’s defined behavior</p>\n<p>Example of LSP violation:</p>\n<p>Changing the apply_discount method in SaleBook to not return a string or to change the discount application logic significantly.</p>\n<pre>class SaleBook(Book):<br>    def apply_discount(self):<br>        # Completely changing the discount application logic<br>        raise NotImplementedError(\"Sale books do not support discounts\")</pre>\n<h3>I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</h3>\n<p>A client should not be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use. Classes should only need to know about the methods that are relevant to them, thus enhancing modularity in the program. Larger interface should be break down into smaller one.</p>\n<pre>class UploadService:<br>   def post(self, file):<br>   # Logic to upload a file<br>        pass<br><br><br>class DeleteService:<br>   def delete(self, file_name):<br>   # Logic to delete a file by filename<br>        pass</pre>\n<p>In this example, UploadService only knows how to upload a file, and DeleteService only knows how to delete a file by filename. Each class has a single responsibility, adhering to the ISP.</p>\n<p>Example of ISP violation:<br>A common violation of the ISP occurs when a single class handles multiple unrelated tasks by merging different responsibilities into one interface.</p>\n<pre>class FileHandler:<br>    def post(self, file):<br>        # Logic to upload a file<br>        pass<br><br>    def get(self, file_name):<br>        # Logic to retrieve a file<br>        pass<br><br>    def delete(self, file_name):<br>        # Logic to delete a file<br>        pass</pre>\n<h3>D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</h3>\n<p>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but rather on abstractions; thus, dependencies should be inverted. High-level modules provide complex logic and low-level modules implement basic functionalities.</p>\n<p>The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) advises that abstractions, such as interfaces or abstract classes, should outline the behaviors expected by high-level modules. Concrete implementations should rely on these abstractions instead of the reverse. Essentially, high-level modules determine ‘what’ needs to be done and low-level modules decide ‘how’ to do it. This approach fosters greater flexibility and decoupling among modules.</p>\n<pre>from abc import ABC, abstractmethod<br><br># Abstract class defining the storage service interface<br>class FileStorageService(ABC):<br>    @abstractmethod<br>    def upload_file(self, file, filename):<br>        pass<br><br>    @abstractmethod<br>    def delete_file(self, filename):<br>        pass<br><br># Concrete implementation of the storage service using S3<br>class S3FileStorageService(FileStorageService):<br>    def __init__(self, bucket_name):<br>        self.bucket_name = bucket_name<br>        self.s3_client = boto3.client('s3')<br><br>    def upload_file(self, file, filename):<br>        # Upload logic here<br><br>    def delete_file(self, filename):<br>        # Deletion logic here<br><br># High-level module depending on the abstract FileStorageService<br>@upload_router.post(\"\")<br>async def upload_file(<br>    user: User = Depends(get_current_user), <br>    file: UploadFile = File(...),<br>    storage_service: FileStorageService = Depends(S3FileStorageService)<br>):<br>    user_id = user.id<br>    file_name = f\"{user_id}_{sha()}_{file.filename}\"<br>    try:<br>        storage_service.upload_file(file, file_name)<br>    except ValueError as e:<br>        return HTTPException(status_code=HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST, detail=str(e))<br>    except Exception as e:<br>        return HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=\"Error on uploading the file\")<br>    return {\"status_code\": HTTP_200_OK, \"filename\": file_name}</pre>\n<p>In this structure, the high-level module (upload_file endpoint) depends on an abstraction (FileStorageService) rather than a concrete implementation (S3FileStorageService). This adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle by decoupling the high-level module from the low-level implementation.</p>\n<p>Example of DIP violation:</p>\n<p>If high-level module directly depends on a low-level module. get_user have direct dependency on a concrete implementation.</p>\n<pre>from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends<br>from .repositories import UserRepository<br><br>app = FastAPI()<br><br>class UserService:<br>    def __init__(self, user_repository: UserRepository):<br>        self.user_repository = user_repository<br><br>    def get_user(self, user_id: int):<br>        return self.user_repository.get_user_by_id(user_id)<br><br>@app.get(\"/users/{user_id}\")<br>async def get_user(user_id: int, user_service: UserService = Depends()):<br>    return user_service.get_user(user_id)</pre>\n<p>In this example, UserService directly depends on UserRepository, a low-level module.</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Incorporating Best Practices</strong></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to SOLID principles, adhering to widely recognized best practices like DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) can further enhance the robustness and maintainability of your FastAPI applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mixing business logic with data access code.</li>\n<li>Overloading endpoints with multiple functionalities.</li>\n<li>Hard-coding dependencies within business logic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Avoiding Pitfalls with SOLID</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>SRP</strong> simplifies testing and maintenance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>OCP</strong> ensures safe extensibility.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>LSP</strong> guarantees substitutable components without side effects.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>ISP</strong> avoids bloated interfaces.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>DIP</strong> promotes flexible and decoupled code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>External Tools to Support SOLID Principles</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>SQLAlchemy</strong>: Facilitates SRP by separating database interactions into model classes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pydantic</strong>: Ensures valid data handling separate from business logic.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dependency Injection Containers</strong> like FastAPI’s Depends provide a way to dynamically manage and inject dependencies, adhering to the DIP.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example of using ‘Depends’:</p>\n<pre>@app.get(\"/users/{user_id}\")<br>async def get_user(user_id: int, user_service: UserService = Depends(get_user_service)):<br>    return user_service.get_user(user_id)</pre>\n<h3>Latest Tools and IntelliCode</h3>\n<p><strong>Using IntelliCode</strong>: Microsoft’s IntelliCode in Visual Studio provides several features that enhance coding efficiency and adherence to best practices.

It supports asynchronous programming and comes with automatic data validation, making it an ideal choice for developing efficient and scalable applications. Integrating SOLID principles into your FastAPI projects not only enhances code maintainability but also ensures that your APIs remain robust as they scale.</p>\n<p>Let’s get into these principles and how they apply to FastAPI!</p>\n<h3>S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h3>\n<p>Each module or class should have<strong> only one reason to change</strong>, meaning that it should have only <strong>one responsibility</strong>. In FastAPI, this can be applied by managing your application into<strong> separate components</strong>.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/560/1*e5q7qryFmUHIs2fl8z8qBg.png\"><figcaption>Example of the module structures</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Controllers: Use to manage API endpoints. Remember to adhere SRP, each endpoint should only do one thing.</li></ul>\n<pre>@auth_router.post(\"/login\", tags=[AuthRouterTags.auth])<br>async def login(credentials: Credentials):<br>    # Login logic<br>    pass<br>def login(<br>    response: Response,<br>    payload: LoginSchema = Body(),<br>    session: Session = Depends(get_db),<br>):<br>    return auth.login(response, session, payload)<br><br>@auth_router.post(\"/logout\", tags=[AuthRouterTags.auth])<br>def logout(<br>    response: Response,<br>    payload: LogoutSchema = Body(),<br>    session: Session = Depends(get_db),<br>):<br>    \"\"\"Processes user's logout request.\"\"\"o<br>    return auth.logout(response, session, payload)</pre>\n<ul><li>Models: Use to represent your data structures their database mapping. SQLAlchemy is a popular choice for ORM in FastAPI.</li></ul>\n<pre>from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String<br>from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base<br><br>Base = declarative_base()<br><br>class User(Base):<br>    __tablename__ = \"users\"<br>    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)<br>    email = Column(String, unique=True, nullable=False)<br>    username = Column(String, nullable=False)</pre>\n<ul><li>Schemas: Define the structures of your data for input validation and data serialization or deserialization.</li></ul>\n<pre>from pydantic import BaseModel<br><br>class UserCreateSchema(BaseModel):<br>    email: str<br>    username: str<br>    password: str</pre>\n<ul><li>Services: Use to contain core logic of your application, facilitating interactions with models and other data layers. Each function in a service should be focused on performing a single, well-defined task.</li></ul>\n<pre>from .models import User<br>from .db import Session<br><br>def create_user(session: Session, user_data: UserCreateSchema):<br>    db_user = User(username=user_data.username, email=user_data.email, password=user_data.password)<br>    session.add(db_user)<br>    session.commit()<br>    session.refresh(db_user)<br>    return db_user</pre>\n<ul><li>Utils: Contain reusable utility functions that provide common functionalities across your application.</li></ul>\n<pre>def hash_password(password: bytes) -&gt; bytes:<br>    return bcrypt.hashpw(password, bcrypt.gensalt())</pre>\n<blockquote><strong>Integrating DRY with SRP</strong></blockquote>\n<p>DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns. Integrating DRY within SRP means ensuring that functionalities that are used multiple times across different modules or classes are abstracted into their own single responsibility units. This not only reduces code duplication but also aligns with SRP by compartmentalizing responsibilities.</p>\n<p>For example, if authentication logic is used in multiple places, instead of duplicating the verification code, it should be extracted into a separate authentication service or utility function. This approach upholds SRP by assigning the responsibility of authentication to a single, dedicated component and adheres to DRY by avoiding code repetition across different endpoints or services.</p>\n<p><strong>Example of SRP violation and Lack of DRY:</strong></p>\n<p>Combining user retrieval and update in a single endpoint does more than one thing, thus violating SRP, and if similar logic is repeated elsewhere, it also breaches the DRY principle:</p>\n<pre>@app.post(\"/user/{user_id}\")<br>async def get_and_update_user(user_id: int, update_data: UserUpdateSchema):<br>    user = get_user_by_id(user_id)  # Retrieve user<br>    if not user:<br>        return {\"error\": \"User not found\"}<br><br>    if update_data.should_update:<br>        updated_user = update_user(user_id, update_data)<br>        return {\"message\": \"User updated\", \"user\": updated_user}<br><br>    return {\"user\": user}</pre>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Best Practice</strong>:</blockquote>\n<p>The correct way is to separate those two functionalities into different endpoints for retrieval (GET /user/{user_id}) and update (PATCH /user/{user_id}). Each endpoint should then call on dedicated functions that handle one specific task, ensuring both SRP and DRY principles are respected.</p>\n<h3>O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</h3>\n<p>Object or entities, such as classes, modules, and functions, should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This principle relates to inheritance in OOP. It highlights the importance of making existing classes to be easily inherited. Rather than altering or modifying a class, which might degrade its quality, it’s preferable to design the class with openness for inheritance. Inheritance should be applied when encounter similar requirements.</p>\n<pre>from typing import Optional<br>from pydantic import UUID4, BaseModel, Field, EmailStr<br><br>class UserBaseSchema(BaseModel):<br>    email: EmailStr<br>    first_name: str<br>    middle_name: str<br>    last_name: str<br><br>class UserSchema(UserBaseSchema):<br>    id: UUID4<br>    is_active: bool = Field(default=False)<br>    refresh_token: Optional[str]<br>    access_token: Optional[str]<br><br>    class Config:<br>        from_attributes = True</pre>\n<p>In this example, UserSchema extends UserBaseSchema to add more attributes without modifying the original UserBaseSchema class. This demonstrates the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Open for Extension</strong>: You have added new functionality (additional fields like id, is_active, refresh_token, and access_token) by extending UserBaseSchema.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Closed for Modification</strong>: You have not changed UserBaseSchema. It remains intact and unchanged, ensuring existing functionality is not broken.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example of OCP violation:</p>\n<p>A common violation of the OCP occurs when a class is modified to add new functionality instead of creating a new class to extend the existing one. Using the same context, here’s how the violation would look if UserBaseSchema was modified directly:</p>\n<pre>from typing import Optional<br>from pydantic import UUID4, BaseModel, Field, EmailStr<br><br>class UserBaseSchema(BaseModel):<br>    email: EmailStr<br>    first_name: str<br>    middle_name: str<br>    last_name: str<br>    id: UUID4  # Added field, which modifies the original class<br>    is_active: bool = Field(default=False)  # Added field<br>    refresh_token: Optional[str]  # Added field<br>    access_token: Optional[str]  # Added field<br><br>    class Config:<br>        from_attributes = True</pre>\n<p>What you should is making a new class UserSchema which extends UserBaseSchema</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>Best Practice</strong>:</blockquote>\n<p>The best practice is to maintain the integrity of the original class by extending it through inheritance, as demonstrated in the correct example. This method adheres to the OCP by allowing the base class to remain unchanged and robust, while new functionality is added in a derived class, promoting reusability and easier maintenance.</p>\n<h3>L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</h3>\n<p>Objects of a superclass can be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the program’s functionality.</p>\n<p>In simple way, if you are making an instance from class B, which is a child class from parent class A, then you should be able to use objects of class B wherever objects of class A are expected, without causing any unexpected behavior or errors. This ensures that the class B (subclass) can seamlessly subsitute the class A (superclass) in any context.</p>\n<pre>class Book(BaseModel):<br>    title: str<br>    def apply_discount(self):<br>        # Logic for applying discount<br>        return \"Discount applied\"<br><br>class SaleBook(Book):<br>    def apply_discount(self):<br>        discount = super().apply_discount()<br>        return f\"{discount} and Sale discount applied\"<br><br>@app.get(\"/sale-book\")<br>def sale_book():<br>    book = SaleBook(title=\"Harry Potter\")<br>    return {\"message\": book.apply_discount()}</pre>\n<p>In this example, SaleBookcan replaceBookwithout altering the expected behavior, adhering to the superclass’s defined behavior</p>\n<p>Example of LSP violation:</p>\n<p>Changing the apply_discount method in SaleBook to not return a string or to change the discount application logic significantly.</p>\n<pre>class SaleBook(Book):<br>    def apply_discount(self):<br>        # Completely changing the discount application logic<br>        raise NotImplementedError(\"Sale books do not support discounts\")</pre>\n<h3>I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</h3>\n<p>A client should not be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use. Classes should only need to know about the methods that are relevant to them, thus enhancing modularity in the program. Larger interface should be break down into smaller one.</p>\n<pre>class UploadService:<br>   def post(self, file):<br>   # Logic to upload a file<br>        pass<br><br><br>class DeleteService:<br>   def delete(self, file_name):<br>   # Logic to delete a file by filename<br>        pass</pre>\n<p>In this example, UploadService only knows how to upload a file, and DeleteService only knows how to delete a file by filename. Each class has a single responsibility, adhering to the ISP.</p>\n<p>Example of ISP violation:<br>A common violation of the ISP occurs when a single class handles multiple unrelated tasks by merging different responsibilities into one interface.</p>\n<pre>class FileHandler:<br>    def post(self, file):<br>        # Logic to upload a file<br>        pass<br><br>    def get(self, file_name):<br>        # Logic to retrieve a file<br>        pass<br><br>    def delete(self, file_name):<br>        # Logic to delete a file<br>        pass</pre>\n<h3>D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</h3>\n<p>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but rather on abstractions; thus, dependencies should be inverted. High-level modules provide complex logic and low-level modules implement basic functionalities.</p>\n<p>The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) advises that abstractions, such as interfaces or abstract classes, should outline the behaviors expected by high-level modules. Concrete implementations should rely on these abstractions instead of the reverse. Essentially, high-level modules determine ‘what’ needs to be done and low-level modules decide ‘how’ to do it. This approach fosters greater flexibility and decoupling among modules.</p>\n<pre>from abc import ABC, abstractmethod<br><br># Abstract class defining the storage service interface<br>class FileStorageService(ABC):<br>    @abstractmethod<br>    def upload_file(self, file, filename):<br>        pass<br><br>    @abstractmethod<br>    def delete_file(self, filename):<br>        pass<br><br># Concrete implementation of the storage service using S3<br>class S3FileStorageService(FileStorageService):<br>    def __init__(self, bucket_name):<br>        self.bucket_name = bucket_name<br>        self.s3_client = boto3.client('s3')<br><br>    def upload_file(self, file, filename):<br>        # Upload logic here<br><br>    def delete_file(self, filename):<br>        # Deletion logic here<br><br># High-level module depending on the abstract FileStorageService<br>@upload_router.post(\"\")<br>async def upload_file(<br>    user: User = Depends(get_current_user), <br>    file: UploadFile = File(...),<br>    storage_service: FileStorageService = Depends(S3FileStorageService)<br>):<br>    user_id = user.id<br>    file_name = f\"{user_id}_{sha()}_{file.filename}\"<br>    try:<br>        storage_service.upload_file(file, file_name)<br>    except ValueError as e:<br>        return HTTPException(status_code=HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST, detail=str(e))<br>    except Exception as e:<br>        return HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=\"Error on uploading the file\")<br>    return {\"status_code\": HTTP_200_OK, \"filename\": file_name}</pre>\n<p>In this structure, the high-level module (upload_file endpoint) depends on an abstraction (FileStorageService) rather than a concrete implementation (S3FileStorageService). This adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle by decoupling the high-level module from the low-level implementation.</p>\n<p>Example of DIP violation:</p>\n<p>If high-level module directly depends on a low-level module. get_user have direct dependency on a concrete implementation.</p>\n<pre>from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends<br>from .repositories import UserRepository<br><br>app = FastAPI()<br><br>class UserService:<br>    def __init__(self, user_repository: UserRepository):<br>        self.user_repository = user_repository<br><br>    def get_user(self, user_id: int):<br>        return self.user_repository.get_user_by_id(user_id)<br><br>@app.get(\"/users/{user_id}\")<br>async def get_user(user_id: int, user_service: UserService = Depends()):<br>    return user_service.get_user(user_id)</pre>\n<p>In this example, UserService directly depends on UserRepository, a low-level module.</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Incorporating Best Practices</strong></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to SOLID principles, adhering to widely recognized best practices like DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) can further enhance the robustness and maintainability of your FastAPI applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mixing business logic with data access code.</li>\n<li>Overloading endpoints with multiple functionalities.</li>\n<li>Hard-coding dependencies within business logic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Avoiding Pitfalls with SOLID</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>SRP</strong> simplifies testing and maintenance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>OCP</strong> ensures safe extensibility.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>LSP</strong> guarantees substitutable components without side effects.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>ISP</strong> avoids bloated interfaces.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>DIP</strong> promotes flexible and decoupled code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>External Tools to Support SOLID Principles</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>SQLAlchemy</strong>: Facilitates SRP by separating database interactions into model classes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pydantic</strong>: Ensures valid data handling separate from business logic.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dependency Injection Containers</strong> like FastAPI’s Depends provide a way to dynamically manage and inject dependencies, adhering to the DIP.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Example of using ‘Depends’:</p>\n<pre>@app.get(\"/users/{user_id}\")<br>async def get_user(user_id: int, user_service: UserService = Depends(get_user_service)):<br>    return user_service.get_user(user_id)</pre>\n<h3>Latest Tools and IntelliCode</h3>\n<p><strong>Using IntelliCode</strong>: Microsoft’s IntelliCode in Visual Studio provides several features that enhance coding efficiency and adherence to best practices.
